C-programming according to Dr Chuck (KLE)

Cannot process concurrent requests
Specific and directed
Single-thread control-flow constructions ; tests, loops, grouping, and sub-programs
Does not offer parallel operations or synchronization.

C-Python currently uses a variant of FNV hash function, modified to reduce the amount and cost of hash collisions for common strings.

First character of the string is added twice, the first time with a bit-shift of 7.
The length of the input string is XOR ed to the final value.

C-code
	Py_uhash_t x;
	Py_ssize_t len;
	/*p is either 1,2 or 4 byte type*/
	Unsigned char *p;
	Py_ucS2 *p;
	Py_UCS *p;
